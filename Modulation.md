# modulation 

The concept of modulation is essential to communication systems since it enables anumber of different signals to all share the same medium.The combining of the number of signals to share a communication medium by dividing it into different frequency bands for each signal is called **frequency-division multi-plexing**

There are two types of modulation

- amplitude modulation
- frequency modulation

## amplitude modulation
The amplitude of a sine wave is varried in synchrony with the information bearing signal.The sine wave is called **the carrier**.Amplitude modulation is technologically quite simple,and the bandwidthof the amplitude modulated carrier is at **most twice the bandwidth** of the modulating signal.However,an amplitude modulated carrier is very prone to the deleterious effects of additive noise

It's the type of modulation used for **AM radio broadcasting**.the frequency of the carrier is always much higher than the frequency of of the modulating waveform.the carrier frequency can be in the range of **550kHZ to 1,600kHz*

## frequency modulation
Is more complicated than amplitude modulation,and the bandwidthof a frequency modulatedcarriercan be many times than that of the modulating signal,however the process of demodulating afrequency modulated carrier eliminates much of the deleterious effects of additive noise,this trade off between bandwidth and noise reduction characterises most communication situations.

multiplexing
## Types

- space-division multiplexing
- time division multiplexing
- frequency-division multiplexing

The waveform that carries the baseband signal to another range of frequenciesis called **carrier waveform** or simply **carrier**,the process by which it's accomplished is called **modulation**.

The information bearing signal is used to modulate the carrier and so it is sometimes called **modulating signal**.

The information bearing signal is sometimes called **baseband signal**. The waveform that results from the modulation of the carrier by the baseband signal is called **modulated carrier** or the **modulated signal**. 
The process then has two inputs:

the baseband (modulating)signal
carrier The process of modulation is performed by an electronic device called a **modulator*". Although the carrier can be any wave shaped, it usually is a sine wave that has its amplitude, frequency or phase varried in synchrony with the baseband signal.
